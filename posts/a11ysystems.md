displaytitle: Accessibility systems for accessibility fixes
---

I wrote an article for [Assistiv Labs](https://assistivlabs.com/) called [Creating accessibility systems to fix accessibility issues](https://assistivlabs.com/articles/accessibility-systems). I have to give the folks at Assistiv Labs a huge thanks for letting me get on my soapbox about prioritizing continuous activities and decreasing friction for doing accessibility work.

Since publishing, the article has been featured in [A11yWeekly's issue #433](https://a11yweekly.com/issue/433/) and [WebAIM's January newsletter](https://webaim.org/newsletter/2025/january). Neat!
