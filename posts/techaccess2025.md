I was asked to speak for the second time at Tech Access Oklahoma this year! I gave a talk about accessibility community and systems which (spoilers) are the two moving parts of accessibility operations. My thanks go out to all the kind folks at [Oklahoma ABLE Tech](https://www.okabletech.org/) for hosting and giving me the opportunity to connect and re-connect to folks in our community!
