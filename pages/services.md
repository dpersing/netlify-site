I help people plan and establish sustainable, data-driven accessibility education and operations that center disabled people.

## Consulting

I provide consulting and workshops to help organizations make their accessibility training and operations better, or to establish them in the first place. I can help you figure out what your organization is ready to do and support you in getting it done.

## Speaking

I am available to speak at organizations and conferences on topics such as:

- Accessibility education and literacy
- Accessibility operations and programs
- Creating communities of practice around accessibility
- Accessibility for people with chronic illness and cognitive disabilities
- Other topics upon request

## Mentoring

Do you have questions about entering the digital accessibility space? Want to add accessibility skills to your toolkit? I offer one-time and ongoing mentorship to help you on your accessibility journey.
